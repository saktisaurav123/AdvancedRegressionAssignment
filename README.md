# Project Name
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
Train.csv has all the variables required to predict th sale price

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
- Many values are missing from the variables. Some columns needed to be removed, some needed to be filled with appropriate values 
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
- 21 variables out of the 81 variables should be sufficient enough to be able to predict the sle price.
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
- We have achieved 85% accuracy and 0.0001 as optimal value for rifgr and lasso.
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
- :'LotArea','1stFlrSF','2ndFlrSF','OverallQual','Neighborhood_NoRidge' are important variables
